    <h1>Privacy Policy for BerryBreach</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: May 17, 2025</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to BerryBreach ("we", "us", "our", or "BerryBreach"). We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("user," "you," or "your"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you download, install, access, or use our BerryBreach desktop application (the "Application") and any related services, including our website and API (collectively, the "Services").</p>
      <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the Services.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with our <a href="https://glvckoma.github.io/BerryBreach-Privacy-Policy/TERMS.html" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways when you use our Services. The information we may collect includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Discord Account Information:</strong> When you choose to authenticate or log in to BerryBreach using your Discord account, we collect your Discord User ID. We may also receive your Discord username/tag and email address if provided by Discord's API and necessary for account creation, authentication, communication, and support purposes within our Services. The specific information shared by Discord is subject to your Discord privacy settings and Discord's own privacy policy.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> We may collect your IP address when you use our Services (e.g., interact with our API server). This is used for security purposes such as abuse prevention (e.g., detecting suspicious activity, rate limiting API requests), for diagnostic and troubleshooting purposes, and to determine general geographic location for analytics (e.g., country-level).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Data:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>When you purchase credits or other paid features within the Application, payments are processed by our third-party payment processor, Stripe. We do not directly collect, store, or have access to your full credit card details or other sensitive payment information. Stripe handles this information directly. However, we may receive transaction confirmation details from Stripe, such as the amount paid, date of transaction, a unique transaction identifier, and partial payment information (like the last four digits of a card or card type) for the purposes of managing your credits, providing customer support regarding transactions, and for our internal accounting and record-keeping. For more details, please review <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">Stripe’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data & Application Interaction:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>We may collect information about how you use and interact with the Application and our Services. This may include features accessed, actions taken within the Application (e.g., performing an account check), usernames of accounts checked (for the purpose of tracking checks against your credit balance and for internal logging if an error occurs during a check), timestamps of activity, errors encountered, crash reports, and general usage patterns or statistics. This data is primarily used in an aggregated and/or anonymized form to improve our Services, monitor performance, identify and fix issues, and enhance user experience. Passwords for third-party accounts (such as Animal Jam Classic accounts) are not part of this collected Usage Data.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Device and Application Information:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>We may collect basic information about the device on which the Application is installed and about the Application itself, such as device operating system, application version, and unique identifiers generated by the Application for installation tracking or error reporting. This helps us provide support and improve compatibility.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Important Note on Third-Party Account Credentials (e.g., Animal Jam Classic):</strong> When you input credentials (username and password) for a third-party account (such as an Animal Jam Classic account) into the Application for the purpose of performing a check, these credentials are used by the Application on your device to attempt to communicate with the third-party service. <strong>We do not knowingly collect, store on our servers, or log these third-party passwords beyond their temporary, ephemeral use in your computer's volatile memory (RAM) during an active check session initiated and controlled by you.</strong> Once the check is complete or the session ends, these passwords are not designed to be retained by our Application or transmitted to our servers. You are responsible for the security of credentials you input into the Application.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
      <p>We are committed to maintaining your trust, and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share the information we collect. We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your Personal Data with unrelated third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
      <p>We may share information we have collected about you in the following situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with trusted third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include:
          <ul>
            <li>Payment processing (e.g., Stripe).</li>
            <li>Data hosting, cloud computing, and infrastructure provision (e.g., DigitalOcean for our API server and database).</li>
            <li>Customer support tools or platforms.</li>
            <li>Analytics services (data is typically anonymized or aggregated).</li>
            <li>Error tracking and crash reporting services.</li>
          </ul>
          These service providers are contractually obligated to protect your data, maintain its confidentiality, and use it only for the specific purposes for which it was disclosed to them and in accordance with our instructions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>By Law or to Protect Rights:</strong> If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, rule, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (b) enforce our Terms of Service or other agreements or policies; (c) investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of BerryBreach, our users, or others, we may share your information as permitted or required. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via a prominent notice on our service of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregated or Anonymized Data:</strong> We may share aggregated or anonymized information, which does not directly identify you, with third parties for various purposes, including research, analysis, service improvement, or to understand usage trends.</li>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose with your explicit consent.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We use measures such as data encryption (where appropriate), access controls, and secure software development practices.</p>
      <p>While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. You transmit personal information at your own risk.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as outlined in this Privacy Policy, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, or to resolve disputes.</p>
      <p>Generally, this means we will keep your account information as long as your account is active. Transaction data may be kept for longer periods as required by financial regulations. Usage data that is anonymized or aggregated may be kept indefinitely for analytical purposes.</p>
      <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it. If this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
      <p>You may request the deletion of your account and associated personal data by contacting us as described in Section 11 ("Contact Us"). We will respond to such requests in accordance with applicable law.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., if you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, California, etc.), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These rights may include:</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our Services are not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, individuals under the age of 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction if it is higher). If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information from our records as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child under 13 has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us using the details in Section 11 ("Contact Us").</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>9. Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <p>Our desktop Application itself generally does not use cookies in the traditional web browser sense. However, when you interact with our Services, certain technologies may be employed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Payment Processor:</strong> Our third-party payment processor, Stripe, may use cookies or similar tracking technologies on their checkout pages to process payments and prevent fraud. We encourage you to review Stripe’s privacy policy for more information on their practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Website/API Interactions:</strong> If you interact with any associated websites or our API, standard web technologies like cookies, local storage, or server logs might be used for session management, authentication, analytics, and security. These would be used in line with the purposes outlined in this policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not currently respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals for our website or API as there is no industry-standard approach for DNT signals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
