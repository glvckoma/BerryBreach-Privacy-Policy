    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: May 17, 2025</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms & Binding Agreement</h2>
      <p>By downloading, accessing, installing, or using the BerryBreach desktop application (the "Application") and any related services, websites, or documentation (collectively, the "Services"), you ("User," "you," "your") signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with all of these Terms, you are expressly prohibited from using the Services and must discontinue use immediately.</p>
      <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you and the operators of BerryBreach ("we," "us," or "our") concerning your access to and use of the Services.</p>
      <p>Your use of the Services is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="https://glvckoma.github.io/BerryBreach-Privacy-Policy/PRIVACY.html" target="_blank">https://glvckoma.github.io/BerryBreach-Privacy-Policy/PRIVACY.html</a> and is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

    <section class="warning-section">
      <h3>2. CRITICAL WARNINGS, USER ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK</h3>
      <p><strong>BEFORE USING BERRYBREACH, YOU MUST CAREFULLY READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE FOLLOWING:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>NO AFFILIATION WITH THIRD PARTIES:</strong> BerryBreach is an independent, third-party application. <strong>It is NOT affiliated with, endorsed, authorized, sponsored, or approved by WildWorks, Inc., Animal Jam, Animal Jam Classic, or any other third-party platform or game (collectively, "Third-Party Platforms").</strong> All trademarks, service marks, and trade names related to such Third-Party Platforms are the property of their respective owners.</li>
        <li><strong>HIGH RISK OF THIRD-PARTY TERMS OF SERVICE VIOLATION:</strong> The primary function of BerryBreach involves interacting with the systems of Third-Party Platforms (specifically Animal Jam Classic) in an automated manner. This activity is <strong>HIGHLY LIKELY TO BE CONSIDERED A VIOLATION OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE of Animal Jam Classic</strong> or other Third-Party Platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES:</strong> As a result of using BerryBreach, you face a <strong>SIGNIFICANT RISK</strong> of consequences imposed by Third-Party Platforms, including but not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Temporary or permanent suspension or termination of your game account(s) on Animal Jam Classic or other platforms.</li>
                <li>Temporary or permanent banning of your IP address(es).</li>
                <li>Loss of virtual items, currency, or account progress.</li>
                <li>Other penalties as determined by the Third-Party Platform.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>USE ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK & ASSUMPTION OF ALL RISKS:</strong> You acknowledge that BerryBreach interacts with systems we do not control. The Services are provided "AS IS." <strong>YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS SOLELY AND ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU VOLUNTARILY ASSUME ALL RISKS</strong> associated with the use of the Services, including but not limited to the risks outlined in this section.</li>
        <li><strong>USER RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLIANCE:</strong> You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with the terms of service, community guidelines, and any other policies of Animal Jam Classic and any other Third-Party Platform you interact with through BerryBreach. We are not responsible for your failure to comply with such third-party terms.</li>
        <li><strong>NO GUARANTEE OF FUNCTIONALITY OR ACCURACY:</strong> We do not guarantee that the Services will always be available, uninterrupted, secure, accurate, or error-free, or that results obtained from the use of the Services will be accurate or reliable. The Services' functionality depends on the continued operation of Third-Party Platforms, which can change their systems or block access at any time without notice.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>By proceeding to use the Services, you explicitly acknowledge and agree to all points within this Section 2.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Services. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that you: (a) are at least 13 years of age; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) your registration and your use of the Services is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Account and Credits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any account information used to access or utilize BerryBreach (e.g., your Discord account if used for authentication with BerryBreach) and for all activities that occur under your BerryBreach account or through your use of the Application. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Credits:</strong> The Services may require the use of "credits" to perform certain actions, such as account checks. Free credits may be provided periodically at our discretion. Additional credits can be purchased through the Application. Each designated action (e.g., an account check) performed by the Application consumes one credit, regardless of the outcome of that action (e.g., whether an account is found valid, invalid, or if an error occurs), unless otherwise specified for particular credit packages or subscription plans.</li>
        <li><strong>Payments & Refunds:</strong> Payments for credits are processed via third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe). By making a purchase, you agree to the terms and conditions of the respective payment processor. <strong>ALL PURCHASES OF CREDITS ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE</strong>, except as expressly required by applicable law or in the rare event of a verified service failure directly attributable to a technical fault within the BerryBreach Application itself (and not due to actions by Third-Party Platforms or user error), as determined in our sole and absolute discretion. We are not responsible for any fees, charges, or taxes associated with your purchases.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Acceptable and Prohibited Uses</h2>
      <p>You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You specifically agree not to, and not to attempt to:</p>

        <li>Access, check, verify, or otherwise interact with any game account (including Animal Jam Classic accounts) for which you do not have legitimate, verifiable ownership or explicit, prior, and ongoing permission from the rightful owner.</li>
        <li><strong>Violate, or facilitate the violation of, the terms of service, community guidelines, or any other rules or policies of any Third-Party Platform, including but not limited to Animal Jam Classic, in connection with your use of BerryBreach.</strong></li>
        <li>Use the Services in any way that infringes upon the intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights of any party.</li>

        <li>Distribute, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, transfer, or otherwise make the Application or Services available to any third party without our express prior written permission.</li>
        <li>Use any automated system, including without limitation "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," to access the Services in a manner that sends more request messages to our servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser (except as may be the result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with our express consent).</li>
        <li>Interfere with, disrupt, or create an undue burden on the Services or the networks or services connected to the Services, or bypass any measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Services.</li>

        <li>Use the Services to develop a competing product or service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in our sole discretion, violates this provision, including without limitation, suspending or terminating access to the Services and reporting you to law enforcement authorities.</p>

      <p>Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Huntington, West Virginia, before one arbitrator.
